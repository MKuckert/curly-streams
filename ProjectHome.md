In Java, .Net and most other languages object oriented stream classes are available in the default libraries. This project trys to implement some common classes to handle input and output in a professional OO-way. PHP already has a stream mechanism, but that's procedural and not quite easy to use.

Currently implemented stream classes:

  * EchoStream
  * BufferedInputStream
  * BufferedOutputStream
  * FileStream
  * FileInputStream
  * FileOutputStream
  * MemoryStream
  * MemoryInputStream
  * MemoryOutputStream
  * BinaryInputStream
  * EmptyInputStream
  * InfiniteInputStream
  * AppendInputStream
  * XmlOutputStream
  * StreamWrapper

For every class is a unit test written and the code coverage of the sourcecode is currently over 95% to ensure best quality.
